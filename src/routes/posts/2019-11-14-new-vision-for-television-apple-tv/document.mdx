Details of the long-awaited Apple TV + service was announced at the Apple Special Event. The service will be active in more than 100 countries at the same time, with new shows being added each month. It will be launched on November 1st and starts at $4.99 per month for a family account with a seven-day free trial.
“Apple TV + is an unrivaled global video service that includes completely original productions” said Jamie Erlicht, President of Apple’s Global Video and added: “We look forward to offering audiences the opportunity to watch these engaging stories everywhere, giving them a rich, personalized experience on all of their favorite displays.”
The service will be available on the Apple TV app on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod touch, Mac and other platforms, including online at tv.apple.com.
According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, users can get a one year subscription for free with a purchase of a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV.
What is included?
It is known that the original Apple film and TV series will be on this platform, although the number is not yet clear. Since the beginning of summer trailers of the ambitious ones have been published; The Morning Show, Snoopy in Space, Dickinson and For All Mankind.
I have tried to briefly summarize the topics of the series whose trailers have been published so far. If anyone wants to know more about Apple’s TV+’ content, let’s get them here!
The sci-fi series For All Mankind will take audiences back to the 1960s, when space racing was the most contentious. However, this time the winner will be Russia, not the United States. In the series, where we will witness an alternative flow of history, Russia managed to send people to the Moon before America. Instead of pioneering the space race, the US has to follow a step behind Russia, which is why it has to continue to invest in its space program. The series, which we will see alternative versions of historical figures, tells the story of engineers, astronauts and their families at the center of the space race.

The Morning Show: The series tells the story of three journalists at different points in their profession. Aniston portrays an age-old morning news host. Witherspoon, on the other hand, meets the audience as a reporter who feels that she has lost his identity. Carrell appears on the show as a journalist wrestling with the consequences of allegations of sexual harassment. Although the trio’s professions will settle in the center of the series, the changing face of the morning news will also be described in the series. According to a press release from Apple, The Morning Show “ego, ambition and unguided search for power” will be discovered.
Bringing a dark perspective to youth stories, the comedy Dickinson focuses on society, gender and family barriers through the eyes of young and rebellious poet Emily Dickinson.
The trailer of Snoopy in Space was released during the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s footstep on the Moon. In the new Peanuts series, Snoopy, Woodstock, Charlie Brown and the rest of the gang have been chosen by NASA to be sent into space, making their dream of becoming an astronaut.

In addition, an action-packed trailer for the series “See” has been released special for the Apple Event. Stating that they received help from visually impaired people in “See”, Tim Cook said that he loved the show and hoped the audience would love it. A futuristic, post-apocalyptic drama, See imagines a world where with no sight. A devastating virus wipes out all but a few million of the Earth’s population, and those that survived were stricken permanently blind. When the newest generation is born sighted, those without sight question what this will mean for their society. Jason Momoa will be starring as the father of twins, Baba Voss, and Hera Hilmar as Maghra, the mother of the babies. I should also remind you that the money spent for only one part of See is 15 million dollars.
Moreover, all the content in the existing iTunes Movie archive can be viewed on the platform and previously purchased content from iTunes can be accessed directly from AppleTV + application.

With this service, Apple is trying to respond to the OTT platforms of companies such as Netflix, Disney +, HBO.
The Disney+ service, which is scheduled to be launched in mid-November, also might have an impact on Apple TV + usage.
As a result, it is quite clear that Apple has many competitors to fight in this field. Although the Apple TV + subscription costs less than most of its competitors, the lack of content may prevent users from purchasing the service. Do you think that Apple can get a big share of the cake in the OTT TV market and change the dynamics of the platform?
